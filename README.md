# Airtable timeline assignment

- How long you spent on the assignment.
    - 3 hours.
- What you like about your implementation.
    - It handles all the UI logic in the viewModel. The composables have minimum logic.
- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
  - Polish the UI with animations for laying out the events.
  - Move the strings and dimensions to resource files.
  - Save more time for the stretch goals.
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
    - I quickly searched for simple timeline designs. I also asked an AI to propose a simple UI that can be implemented in a couple of hours.
- How you would test this if you had more time.
    - Adding unit tests for the ViewModel.
    - Adding UI tests for the composables to make sure the information is being displayed correctly
    - Some manual testing for complex scenarios with overlapping events and many lanes.
